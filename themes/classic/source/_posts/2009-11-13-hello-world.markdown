**Octopress is a blogging framework designed for hackers**, based on [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) the blog aware static site generator powering [Github pages](http://pages.github.com/).
If you don't know what Jekyll is, [Jack Moffitt](http://metajack.im/2009/01/23/blogging-with-git-emacs-and-jekyll/) wrote a good summary:

{% blockquote Jack Moffitt http://metajack.im/2009/01/23/blogging-with-git-emacs-and-jekyll/ Blogging with Git Emacs and Jekyll %}
  Jekyll is a static blog generator; it transforms a directory of input files into another directory of files suitable for a blog. The management of the blog is handled by standard, familiar tools like creating and renaming files, the text editor of your choice, and version control.
{% endblockquote %}

There's no database to set up, and you get to use tools like Emacs, Vim, or TextMate to write your posts, not some lame in-browser text editor. Just write, generate, deploy, using the same tools and patterns you already use for your daily work.
