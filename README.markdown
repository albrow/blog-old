= What is Octopress?

Octopress gives developers a well designed starting point for their blog. It's easy to configure and easy to deploy. Sweet huh?

== Octopress uses
- [Jekyll](http://github.com/henrik/jekyll) a blog aware static site generator (Henrik's fork adds [HAML](http://haml-lang.com) support)
- [Compass](http://compass-style.org) an awesome [SASS](http://sass-lang.com) framework.
- [FSSM](http://github.com/ttilley/fssm/tree/master) + a rake task, automatically regenerates the blog as you work.
- [Serve](http://github.com/jlong/serve) for live previews of the site while in development
- [Rsync](http://samba.anu.edu.au/rsync/) for easy deployment.

= Setup
