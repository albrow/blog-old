## Getting Started

[Create a new repository](https://github.com/repositories/new) for your website then
open up a terminal and follow along. If you plan to host your site on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com) for a user or organization, make sure the
repository is named `your_username.github.com` or `your_organization.github.com`.

    mkdir my_octopress_site
    cd my_octopress_site
    git init
    git remote add octopress git://github.com/imathis/octopress.git
    git pull octopress master
    git remote add origin (your repository url)
    git push origin master

    # Next, if you're using Github user or organization pages,
    # Create a source branch and push to origin source.
    git branch source
    git push origin source


Next, setup an [RVM](http://beginrescueend.com/) and install dependencies.

    rvm rvmrc trust
    bundle install

    # Install pygments (for syntax highlighing)
    sudo easy_install pip
    sudo pip install pygments

Install the default Octopress theme,

    rake install

and you should be all set up to begin blogging with Octopress.

### Generating & Preview

    rake generate   # Generates your blog into the public directory
    rake watch      # Watches files for changes and regenerates your blog
    rake preview    # Watches, and mounts a webserver at http://localhost:4000

Jekyll's built in webbrick server is handy, but if you're a [POW](http://pow.cx) user, you can set it up to work with Octopress like this.

    cd ~/.pow
    ln -s /path/to/octopress
    cd -

Now that you're setup with POW, you'll just run `rake watch` and load up `http://octopress.dev` instead.

## Writing A Post

Create your first post.

    rake post['hello world']

This will put a new post in source/_posts with a name like like `2011-07-3-hello-world.markdown` in the `source/_posts` directory.
Open that file in your favorite text editor and you'll see a block of [yaml front matter](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/yaml-front-matter)
which tells Jekyll how to processes posts and pages.

    ---
    title: Hello World
    date: 2011-07-03 5:59
    layout: post
    ---

Now beneath the yaml block, go ahead and type up a sample post, or use some [inspired filler](http://baconipsum.com/). If you're running the watcher, save and refresh your browser and you
should see the new post show up in your blog index.

Octopress does more than this though. Check out [Blogging with Octopress](#include_link) to learn about all the different ways Octopress makes blogging easier.

## Configuring Octopress

I've tried to keep configuring Octopress fairly simple. Here's a list of files for configuring Octopress.

    _config.yml       # Main config (Jekyll blog settings)
    Rakefile          # Config for Rsync deployment
    config.rb         # Compass config

    sass/custom/_colors.scss      # change your blog's color scheme
    sass/custom/_layout.scss      # change your blog's layout
    sass/custom/_styles.scss      # override your blog's styles

Octopress keeps it's main configurations in two places, the `Rakefile` and the `_config.yml`. You probably won't have to change anything in the rakefile except the
deployment configurations (if you're going to [deploy with Rsync over SSH](#deploy_with_rsync)).

## Deploying

### Deploying with Rsync via SSH

Add your server configurations to the `Rakefile` under Rsync deploy config. To deploy with Rsync, be sure your public key is listed in your server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.

    ssh_user      = "user@domain.com"
    document_root = "~/website.com/"

Now if you run `rake deploy` in your terminal, your `public` directory will be synced to your server's document root.

### Deploying to Github Pages

To setup deployment, you'll want to clone your target repository into the `_deploy` directory in your Octopress project.
If you're using Github project pages, clone the repository for that project, eg `git@github.com:username/project.git`.
If you're using Github user or organization pages, clone the repository `git@github.com:usernem/username.github.com.git`.

    # For Github project pages:
    git clone git@github.com:username/project.git _deploy
    rake config_deploy[gh-pages]

    # For Github user/organization pages:
    git clone git@github.com:username/username.github.com _deploy
    rake config_deploy[master]

    # Now to deploy, you'll run
    rake deploy

The `config_deploy` rake task takes a branch name as an argument and creates a [new empty branch](http://book.git-scm.com/5_creating_new_empty_branches.html), and adds an initial commit.
This prepares your branch for easy deployment. The `rake deploy` task copies the generated blog from the `public` directory to the `_deploy` directory, adds new files, removes old files, sets a commit message, and pushes to Github.
Github will queue your site for publishing (which usually occurs instantly or within minutes if it's your first commit).


### Deploying to a Subdirectory (Github Project Pages does this)

If you're deploying to a subdirectory on your site, or if you're using Github's project pages, make sure you set up your urls correctly in your configs.
You can do this *almost* automatically:

    rake set_root_dir[your/path]

    # To go back to publishing to the document root
    rake set_root_dir[/]

Then update your `_config.yml` and `Rakefile` as follows:

    # _config.yml
    url: http://yoursite.com/your/path

    # Rakefile (if deploying with rsync)
    document_root = "~/yoursite.com/your/path"

To manually configure deployment to a subdirectory, you'll change `_config.yml`, `config.rb` and `Rakefile`

    # Example for deploying to Octopress's Github Pages

    # _config.yml
    destination: public/octopress
    url: http://imathis.github.com/octopress
    subscribe_rss: /octopress/atom.xml
    root: /octopress

    # config.rb - for Compass & Sass
    http_path = "/octopress"
    http_images_path = "/octopress/images"
    http_fonts_path = "/octopress/fonts"
    css_dir = "public/octopress/stylesheets"


    # Rakefile
    public_dir = "public/octopress"
    # If deploying with rsync, update your Rakefile path
    document_root = "~/yoursite.com/your/path"
