Just wanted to let you know that [all the source code for my blog is now available on github](https://github.com/stephenalexbrowne/blog).
Feel free to use/copy/modify any part of it. And if you think my code sucks, let me know how I could make it better.

Recently, I changed the homepage to show truncated versions of longer posts instead of the whole thing. You can click a "read more" link to see the entire post. I also added next and previous links at the bottom of each post. In addition, I made some improvements to the image compression technique which will slightly increase performance.

More posts coming soon!
