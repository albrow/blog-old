*Hello there, and welcome!*

I enjoy writing and I’ve thought about doing this (starting a blog) for a long time. You might have to bear with me in the beginning, because not only is my writing a bit rusty, but I’ve never done anything like this before. In addition to wanting to keep a record of this summer for my own personal sake, I hope that maybe something I say might be helpful or interesting to someone.

I don’t really like the starchiness of these sort of introductions, but since this is my first post, I’d be a fool to not tell you a little about myself. I’m Alex Browne. I’m currently a junior at Duke majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Among many other things, I’m an amateur programmer and graphic designer. In fact, I built and designed this site from scratch as a learning experience. It may be sort of eerie, but some of the posts I make in the near future will be about the inner workings of the site itself, which was created using Ruby on Rails and deployed via Heroku. You might also notice some changes and improvements every now and then.

I’m an aspiring entrepreneur. This summer, I’ve been lucky enough to receive a small grant and office space to get started on my latest project– a website in the education space called NeoTeach. I’m working on the project fulltime in Durham, and I’m doing all the development and design myself. I’ll definitely talk more about the project in detail later on. And in fact, many of my posts will be about my experiences and the lessons I learn as I try to bring this vision into actuality in just a few months.

But that’s certainly not the only thing I’m going to write about. I’ve many more interests and passions. Perhaps, if I’m lucky, some of these random musings will catch your attention as they’ve caught mine.

Well, that’s it for now. Stay tuned for more!
