Yes, I am behind on NeoTeach. Not dreadfully so, but enough to make me want to work harder in order to catch up. Last week I learned that the site crashed when you uploaded larger video files (~30MB). That was a huge problem, because most videos uploaded to the site will be much larger than that. I've spent the entire week scrambling to fix it, moving back and forth between a wide array of possible solutions. Each solution I thought I found came with it's own hidden roadblock, and I slowly began to realize that the internet is simply not designed to handle large files. Still, I was able to eventually find a solution that works.

The whole ordeal has put me about a week behind schedule. Add to the top of that mound of stress the fact that 1) Duke made a deal with a company that is more or less a competitor of mine, 2) the NeoTeach site was completely offline for most of yesterday because of a DDoS attack on our nameservers, and 3) my ToDo list is growing faster than I can finish the the tasks within it.

What else can I do but work even harder than before? I have to finish the site by the time school starts in August. I have to catch up.

I'm writing this post at 4:30 in the morning. I stayed in my office until 3:30 alternating between recording videos, editing them, and writing code. This has been a trend for the past week or so. A few days ago I saw the sun rise. Tonight, as I walked back to my apartment from my office, I had to avoid the sprinklers that only turn on when everyone is assumed asleep.

Luckily, I ***am*** getting a lot done. I've created the first three videos and successfully uploaded them. I've more or less finished the syllabus for the first course, and I've made countless improvements to the design and functionality of the site. Tomorrow I'm going to make a big announcement through the social media channels and see if I can't rally a little more interest and support.

It ***is*** worth it. 

Even as I sit here typing, I can tell that mental exhaustion is preventing me from writing with the eloquence I usually aim for. Before I crash, I'll leave you with a few pictures of the setup I've been using to record videos in my office. There are many more to come!
