In my search for a co-founder, I’ve become determined to go to as many entrepreneurial meetups as I possibly can. There are a lot of these types of events going on, and they’re not too hard to find if you know where to look. Yesterday, I went to two of them. The first was a smaller, informal breakfast in the office of a VC firm. The second was a bigger, more open event in the evening with free beer and chick-fil-a nuggets.

I ran into a wide variety of interesting people and learned a lot by talking with them. I had conversations with people who had been entrepreneurs for their whole lives, some of them (I’d guessed) in their forties. I met someone who was working in the cybersecurity field with a rock-solid team of seasoned hackers and cryptographers. I met a man with a thick black beard down to his belly button, a black hat, and a bluetooth earpiece. He looked sort of like a supremely technologically competent amish fellow, and turned out to be a pretty cool guy. At one point –I kid you not– a guy named Alex introduced me to another guy named Alex who also happened to be a Duke student. I was slightly confused myself, but I cannot possibly imagine befuddlement of the few innocent bystanders, most of them meeting all three of us for the first time.

Anyways, I thought I might take a moment to share a few tips. I’m by no means an expert at these types of events. But I’m at least an attentive and contemplative amateur, and here’s what I’ve learned...


### Have a Short and Effective Pitch

This might go without saying, but you need to be able to tell people what you're working on concisely and effectively. Avoid buzzwords and flaunty language and just get to the point. If people don’t understand you in the first ten seconds, then you’ll quickly bore them. My friend had a great example of an effective one-liner for his business: “We make a mobile app that helps people order drinks at bars.”


### Don't Waste Anyone's Time

Relatedly, you should pay attention to people’s reaction when you talk about your idea. If they don’t seem interested (and some people just won’t be) then wrap it up quickly. Don’t waste people’s time. If they do seem interested, then you can continue to talk about your idea in a little more detail and maybe ask for their opinion if you have questions.
 

### Resist the Urge to Clump

Typically, there will be a handful of people you know and a lot more that you don’t. Resist the urge to just stick with your friends the whole time. It may be uncomfortable, but you have to venture out and meet new people, otherwise the event won’t be worth your time. It’s going to be awkward at first, but that’s okay.
 

### Offer and Ask for Introductions

It’s much better to meet someone through an introduction as opposed to trying to greet them coldly. Try and get the people you know to introduce you to some people you don’t, especially people that could help with something. Likewise, introduce your friends to people that they don’t know, and people that might be able to help them.

If you don’t know anyone at the event, that’s okay too. Rather than standing awkwardly by a group of people who are already engaged in conversation, try to find someone who isn’t already occupied. That person will likely be much more willing to talk to you, and instead of waiting for the right moment to interject, you can just immediately introduce yourself.


### Remember People’s Names

This is something that I personally struggle with. Sometimes when people introduce themselves, I’m so absorbed in what I’m doing that I totally miss their name. There are some things you can do to make it easier. Try repeating their name in your head a few times the first time you hear it. I’ve also found that it helps to call them out by name during conversation. You’ll likely run into this person again, and it’s nice to be able to properly greet them when you do.
 

### Maintain Contact

If you find yourself talking to someone who likes your idea or would be willing to help (or vice versa), give them your contact information and ask for theirs. If people hand you business cards keep them all in the same place. Depending on the level of interest, you could consider shooting a follow up email after the event. In your email, say your name, and offer some little tidbit about yourself or your idea to help jog their memory. Keep it short, and if you think it’s appropriate, you can ask if they would like to meet up again.

That’s all I’ve got. While it’s certainly not expert advice, maybe someone somewhere will find it helpful. If you’re curious, I didn’t have much luck finding a co-founder yesterday, but I did get a few leads. The search shall continue!

Oh, and at my next meetup, I’m considering giving [this tactic](http://xkcd.com/1032/) a try.
