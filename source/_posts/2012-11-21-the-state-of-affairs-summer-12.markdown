This one goes out to my friends and family. I thought it might be a good idea to update everyone on what I’m doing this summer (and honestly, I've sort of grown tired of trying to explain it over and over again).
<br/>

### Lexplode
For a long time now, I’ve been working on a side project with my friend Brian. It’s an iPad word game called Lexplode. The basic premise is this– There is a hexagonal grid of lettered tiles. You can make words with the letters by simply dragging your finger to connect any adjacent tiles in any direction. You can also rearrange the letters by tapping a tile to rotate it and the surrounding tiles. Every so often, a bomb tile will randomly appear on the board, which you must clear out by connecting it with other tiles and forming a word. If you don’t clear out the bomb in time, it explodes and the game is over.

Brian and I formed a company (well technically it’s not a “company” yet) called Pearilous Mobile to sort of serve as an umbrella for Lexplode and any other games we decide to do in the future. Right now, we’re each working on our own independent projects over the summer (I’ll get to that later) so unfortunately we don’t have plans to release a second game anytime soon. However, in the more distant future, it is a real possibility.

We recently released a private beta version of the Lexplode through a service called TestFlight. Please contact me at alex@pearlious.com if you are interested in becoming a beta tester! Based on the feedback we’ve received so far, we intend to make some changes to the game to make it a little bit easier. We will launch the game on the App Store after we feel we’ve sufficiently addressed the major concerns of our beta testers. Hopefully, it’ll be ready near the end of the summer. You can keep up with our progress on the game by following us on [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/PearilousMobile) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/PearilousMobile).

### NeoTeach
And now for my main focus... I’m currently enrolled in a program at Duke called the Summer Innovation Program. I, along with three other teams, received a small amount of funding, office space, and mentorship to start my own company. The project that I’m working on is called NeoTeach. In short, it’s a crowd-sourced learning platform that allows users to submit short videos teaching specific academic concepts. For each concept, there can be several different user-submitted videos. There’s a rating system and the videos sort of compete against each other to try and teach the topic in the most concise and effective way possible. There will also be an interactive quiz for each topic so learners can immediately check their understanding.

I’ve been working on NeoTeach full time for 25 days. I’m constantly searching for a co-founder, but for now I am a team of one. I’ve been doing all the design and development by myself, and I’ve made a lot of progress on the website so far. I have already begun giving sneak-peak access to some of my close friends, and I plan to announce some sort of official beta or prototype very soon. In fact a lot of the development work I planned to do for my minimum viable product is already done. For the remainder of the summer, I’ll be focusing on getting people interested in the idea, especially professors, teachers, and people who might be willing to contribute videos. I’ve already had some success with this, and I’m delighted to find that people are as excited about the idea as I am. If you’d like pre-beta access to the website, you want to help, or you’re just interested in the idea, you can contact me at stephenalexbrowne@gmail.com.

So, that’s what I’ll be devoting my life to this summer. I’ll keep you all updated!
