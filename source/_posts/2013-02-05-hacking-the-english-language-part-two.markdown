## Intro

In [part one](/hacking-the-english-language/),
I discussed some of the shortcomings of the English language
and how we might be able to fix them by using a phonetic alphabet. There were
a few problems with this approach:

1. Heterographs are impossible to distinguish in written text.
2. Frankly, it looks stupid.
3. It requires more letters per word on average.
4. There is not a one-to-one correspondence between letters and sounds.
5. It doesn't fix any problems that are inherent to the language itself.

Now I want to discuss some other changes we could make to address the problems above.
These ideas are a bit more extreme.

*The above reads: "Idea 2: Same Language, Different Alphabet." Depending on your browser and operating
system, it might not render correctly.*

As much as I would love to invent a new alphabet, I can't take credit for this one. It's called the
Shavian Alphabet, and was invented by Ronald Read in the 1950's, as part of a contest posthumously
held and funded by George Bernard Shaw.

The Shavian alphabet consists of 24 consonants and 16 vowels. It actually seems to share some of the
same philosophies of my original post. For example, there is only one correct way to
spell a word and it is obvious. The alphabet is phonetic, and has a one-to-one correspondence between
letters and sounds. Here are some other nice features:

1. There are no separate uppercase letters. Instead, proper nouns and titles are indicated by a preceding 
    "naming dot" (·). This means you have half as many letters to learn.
2. Common words are abbreviated with a single letter. These include: "the" (𐑞), "of" (𐑝), "and" (𐑯), "to" (𐑑),
    and "for" (𐑓).
3. Syllabic consonants are taller than vowels and non-syllabic consonants, and they stick out above or below
    the lines on paper. This results in a visual "hint" for the syllabic division of a word.
4. The name for each of the letters usually starts with the sound it makes. When this is not the case, the 
    sound the letter makes is the accented part of its name, as in mea**s**ure (𐑠) or hu**ng** (𐑙).
5. The letters for voiced and unvoiced consonants are related by a 180&deg; rotation.
6. The eight ligatures are usually shaped like a combination of the letters they represent. For example, the ligature
    yew (𐑿) is shaped like a combination of yea (𐑘) and ooze (𐑵).

Adoption of the Shavian Alphabet has been pretty minimal, as you might have guessed. However, there has been
one book published using it–
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androcles_and_the_Lion_(play)">Androcles and the Lion</a>,
by George Bernard Shaw (of course). Printed versions of the play are hard to come by, 
but a digital version of the prologue is
[available here](http://www.saytheword.org.uk/shavian/androcles20-21.html).

## Ideo 3: Tute Nov Lingvo

*The subheading above is written in Esperanto and translates to "Idea 3: A Completely New Language."*

While trying to hack and rewrite English, I realized you can only get so far before you start
running into problems that are inherent in the language itself. What do we do about homonyms?
How can we solve some ambiguities and inconsistencies? There are those who would rather throw
out the entire language and start from scratch.

### Esperanto

Esperanto is the world's most widely-spoken constructed language. It was created by Dr. Ludwig Lazarus
Zamenhof in the 1870s and 1880s and is intended to be an international auxiliary language. The basic 
idea is that people who speak different languages can easily learn and communicate with Esperanto. There
are roughly 10,000 to 2,000,000 active or fluent Esperanto speakers in the world. Recently, Esperanto was
officially added to Google Translate, making it even easier for people to learn and communicate with it.

Here's a short passage written in Esperanto:

{% blockquote %}
En multaj lokoj de Ĉinio estis temploj de la drako-reĝo. Dum trosekeco oni preĝis en la temploj, ke la drako-reĝo donu pluvon al la homa mondo. Tiam drako estis simbolo de la supernatura estaĵo. Kaj pli poste, ĝi fariĝis prapatro de la plej altaj regantoj kaj simbolis la absolutan aŭtoritaton de feŭda imperiestro. La imperiestro pretendis, ke li estas filo de la drako. Ĉiuj liaj vivbezonaĵoj portis la nomon drako kaj estis ornamitaj per diversaj drakofiguroj. Nun ĉie en Ĉinio videblas drako-ornamentaĵoj, kaj cirkulas legendoj pri drakoj.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote %}
In many places in China, there were temples of the dragon-king. During times of drought, people would pray in the temples that the dragon-king would give rain to the human world. At that time the dragon was a symbol of the supernatural. Later on, it became the ancestor of the highest rulers and symbolised the absolute authority of the feudal emperor. The emperor claimed to be the son of the dragon. All of his personal possessions carried the name "dragon" and were decorated with various dragon figures. Now dragon decorations can be seen everywhere in China and legends about dragons circulate.
{% endblockquote %}

I invite you to check out the [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto) on Esperanto
for more information.

Ĉar vi estas sprita al eniro ĉi tiu enen Guglo traduki, mi supozas ke mi ellasos vin sur pseŭdo-sekreta: Mi estos ŝanĝo de la nomo de mia blogo frue. La nuna nomo de regado ne estas tre eleganta.

### Lojban

Lojban, which translates to "Logic Language," was formed
around 1987 and is based on its predecessor Loglan. It is designed to be logical and completely
unambiguous. The syntax of Lojban is similar to the functions you might see in mathematics
or programming. It also has a simple alphabet and phonetic spelling, root words based on a combination
of the most widely-used languages in the world, and a growing community of speakers and supporters.
Because of its unambiguous nature, Lojban shows promise in human-computer interfaces and also
could be used as an effective intermediate between different languages. 

Here's an excerpt from a poem written in Lojban:

{% blockquote %}
i dei lisri le nu cpare lo cmana
i go'i le nu sisku le ka manci
le rirci xrula poi titla se panci
zi'e poi ia xabju le traji cpana
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote %}
This is a tale of climbing a mountain.
A tale of seeking the wonder
of rare flowers, smelling sweet
and (so I believe) to be found at the very peak.
{% endblockquote %}

*(I would rather not insult the language by attempting to write a clever passage in Lojban here.)*

## Conclusion

The English language is odd. We could improve it, or better yet ditch it entirely, but we won't.
English is simply embeded in our culture and it's here to stay. Still though, it can be interesting
to explore the "what if?"
