### The Problem
If you’ve been following my blog, you know that I’ve been hard at work on my latest project, a crowd-sourced learning platform called NeoTeach. A few days ago, I was proud to open up a beta version of the site for content creators. It’s still far from being done, but right now you can go on the site, create an account, and start uploading videos. If you haven’t already, you can see it for yourself at neoteach.com.
*(update: the site is now at [crowdcourse.com](http://www.crowdcourse.com))*

So far, I’ve had a few visitors, some of whom even created accounts. But not a single video has been uploaded yet. Honestly, I’m not surprised. It’s all because of something I call the “Dance Floor Problem.” (Although I’m sure it’s a widely recognized conundrum and has been called by other names). You see, no one wants to be the first person on the dance floor. We all know that it could potentially be a lot of fun (just look at how shiny it is!). We know that eventually someone is going to have to be the first one on the floor, but even so, no one wants to be that person.

Before I go any further, let me explain that this is distinctly different from the somewhat similar “chicken and egg” problem. The chicken and egg problem occurs when you depend on content to attract content creators. In other words, you need users to start creating content and adding value to the site, but you need content to attract users. This is not the case with NeoTeach. For now, the site is only open to content creators (a.k.a. teachers). The teachers do not gain any direct value from other teachers or other videos, and the lack of content is not really disadvantageous to them. In fact, you could argue that the opposite is true. The less content on the site, the more reputable and popular a teacher could become. The people who upload the first videos have an advantage because they’ll receive the first ratings and will be more likely to show up at the top of the rankings. No, my problem is different.

With NeoTeach, most of the feedback I’ve received so far is along the lines of “It looks great, but it’s hard to tell when there’s no real content yet.” I know that there are people who are passionate about teaching, because they’ve told me so. People are excited about the idea of uploading videos, and they can see how NeoTeach could be a useful tool for teachers and learners alike, but no one wants to be the first one to do it.

### My Solution
I'm new at this, so I'm not claiming that I have the end-all answer to the problem. I thought of a few different approaches. I could experiment with “growth-hacking,” which usually involves creating fake accounts and giving the appearance of participation from multiple individuals. (Almost all dating sites start out this way).  However, it doesn’t work in my case, because videos require a real person behind the camera. Even if I could get away with hiding my face, it would be hard to impersonate different voices and give the appearance of multiple contributors. Besides, I don't want to be dishonest to the users. I still can create videos myself, and I intend to, but they will only count as coming from one source (me). I’m not sure if one person is enough to break the ice.

So, I plan to personally reach out to people who I know are interested in creating videos. If I can establish a personal connection with these potential teachers, it is much more likely that I can convince them to go through with the upload process. I suspect that people will feel more comfortable helping out a friend than they would submitting blindly to some site they’ve never heard of. I’ll ask for their feedback and advice and sincerely take it to heart. I’ll offer to help teachers in any way I can, even if that means buying a camera and personally serving as their cameraman.

I'll actively seek out groups of people who may be interested in submitting videos purely for the joy of teaching (hell, that's my main motivation). These groups include YouTubers who are already creating educational videos, people on education forums, teachers at my old high school and other teachers they know, professors and TA's at Duke, and more. Hopefully I can find enough passionate people that will be eager to upload videos on their own.

And if that doesn't work I'll keep trying different solutions. I could offer incentives to the first people to upload videos, maybe even cash prizes. I'm warry of this sort of approach, however, because it raises a new problem: What happens when you remove the incentives? Will people still be willing to submit videos after that initial boost?

Anyways, I'll keep trying and give you an update if I find a solution that works.

Do you have any ideas on how to tackle this problem? If you're interested in helping, you want to create videos, or you just want to find out more about the project, please contact me at alex@crowdcourse.com. I would be eternally and enormously grateful.
