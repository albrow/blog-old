There exists in certain corners of the globe (mostly West Africa) a magical little member of the botanical family known as synsepalum dulcificum, or more commonly “miracle fruit” or “miracle berry.” What’s so miraculous about this fruit is not its taste, but the strange effect it has on the tastes of other foods. Though the effects still aren’t fully understood, scientists have been able to discern that the most active chemical in the fruit, appropriately called miraculin, changes the shape of certain taste buds and alters sweetness receptors in the tongue such that they behave abnormally. The most noticeable effect is that sour and acidic foods taste inexplicably sweet, while all other tastes are subdued.

In the 1970’s a U.S. company discovered the miracle berry and attempted to market miraculin as an artificial sweetener. It was very effective, and would have had hugely positive implications for diabetics and dieters. Unfortunately, rumor has it that large sugar companies lobbied against miraculin, which resulted in the FDA declaring it a “food additive.” The stricter regulations and requirements of that classification made it impossible for the company to proceed, and miraculin and the berry from whence it came were more or less forgotten in history.

The berry is hard to come by nowadays, but not impossible. In fact, it’s recently been making a comeback in the United States, possibly due to the ease of spreading information through the internet (that’s how I discovered it). The miracle berries are often used for what’s called “taste tripping” parties, where you eat the berry and then experiment with a variety of foods to see how their taste changes.

I recently found an online retailer selling tablets with miracle berry extract. Naturally, I ordered them and invited my friends over for our very own taste tripping party.

Among the foods we tried:

- Pears
- Lemons
- Limes
- Bananas
- Applesauce
- Peanut Butter
- Granola
- Chips and Salsa
- Salami
- Grapes
- Pickles
- Onions
- Pepper Jack Cheese
- Ketchup
- Mustard
- BBQ Sauce

My four friends and I spread out all the food on the table and popped the tablets in our mouths at the same time. The tablets themselves tasted subtly sweet and tangy, sort of like an apple, but different. They took a few minutes to dissolve, and then the fun began.

One of the first things we ate was grapes. I remember that the first one I had tasted pretty normal, and I think the miraculin might take a few minutes to really start kicking in. The second thing we tasted was the limes. They were definitely much sweeter than normal. In fact they were quite delicious. Next, we tried the chips and salsa. Unfortunately, it pretty much just tasted like chips and salsa. Feeling sort of disappointed, we all decided to take a second tablet.

There is no way to not understate this, so I’ll just say it– the second tablet greatly intensified the effect! We tried the salsa again and, man, was it different. It tasted distinctively sweet. We even got the extra hot kind, but somehow it didn’t taste spicy at all. The strangest part was that, even though it didn’t taste like salsa, it still caused our tongues to tingle and sting a little bit. We tried the grapes again, and they were phenomenal.

And then... back to the limes. After that second tablet, they were the most delicious thing I have ever tasted. They were impossibly sweet. Like, imagine the sweetest thing to ever touch your tongue and multiply it tenfold. They were so good that we seriously considered running to the grocery store right then and there to get some more.

One by one, we continued to try different foods until we’d tried everything on the table. As a general trend, the sweet stuff tasted sweeter and everything else tasted weaker. The other fruits –pears, lemons, applesauce– were magnificently tasty, though still not as good as the limes. The peanut butter tasted like it was mixed with honey. The pickles and onions tasted bland, but not necessarily in a bad way. The ketchup, mustard, and BBQ sauce all tasted stronger and sweeter. One of the strangest things we tasted was the salami, which was almost entirely tasteless. It was weird to feel the flavorless texture in my mouth, because you don’t normally notice it.

At one point, we had a competition to see if anyone could eat a grape and keep a straight face. It was nearly impossible. They were so sweet that they caused the muscles in our cheeks and behind our mandibles to tense up, triggering a smile reflex.

All in all, it was a very fun experience. I initially thought this would be a one time thing, but I now I think I would do almost anything to get another miraculin-induced taste of those limes. Perhaps we’ll go taste tripping again sometime.
