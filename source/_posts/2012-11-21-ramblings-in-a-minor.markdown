Right now I’m in the middle of yet another bout of temporary insomnia. As the sandman continues to elude me, I just feel like writing about something. Here goes...

I find it absolutely astounding that music has the ability to evoke certain emotions. It is a fascinating and beautiful phenomenon, one that I appreciate and will never fully understand. Alternating pockets of high and low pressure air strike the eardrum at different velocities and amplitudes. In response, three of smallest bones in the human body, which are attached to the eardrum, vibrate ever so slightly. Attached to those is a series of spiralling nerve-dense tubes. And to that, the fluid-filled cochlea, with minuscule hairs capable of detecting vibrations and changes in the level of the fluid within it. The little hairs send electrical impulses to the brain when stimulated. The brain fires a chain reaction through a series intricately connected neurons. Then if the neurons happen to fire off in some particular pattern there’s a chemical response. And out of all this... Happiness. Sorrow. Anger. Peace of mind. Teary eyes. A change in heart rate. Or a host of other reactions, each somehow inspired by the above chain of events which began *–don’t forget–* with mere pockets of air.

Music has become an integral part of all of our lives. It is an inherent part of human existence, so much so that one might find it difficult to last a whole day without hearing it– whether on the radio, on television, or even something as simple as a hum or whistle.

Among the most potent sounds to my ears are a well-done performance of Bach’s Cello Suite No. 1 or the angelic voices of the choir at the Duke Chapel, the harmonies reverberating all the way up to even the highest ogives in the ceiling. In these I can hear and feel a profound peace, a beautiful, elaborate reassurance that every trouble in the world will come to pass.

When I was about four years old, my parents enrolled me in private piano lessons. (edit: I've been reminded that I first was introduced to piano via a computer program. Later I took lessons at the elementary school. Also, I was five). I hated them, probably because I grew bored of the submediocre melodies which I had been instructed to learn, the most sophisticated of which was the ever-memorable “Hot Cross Buns.” Or perhaps I was too young to understand what I was doing, or my fingers were too small and weak to adequately play the keys. Whatever the reason, I hated it. I promptly quit.

Over the course of the years, I’ve obtained a new interest in music; I see it in a different light. I’ve learned more instruments– First the drum set (surely aggravating my parents with an incessant cacophony of clashes and booms). In middle school I learned to play the trumpet. I picked up piano again later on, this time learning on my own. And most recently, I’ve started teaching myself guitar.

Music expresses that which cannot be put into words and that which cannot remain silent.

While there is something to be said about the power of passively listening to a well-performed piece, usually one which has been performed with ability far beyond my own, I enjoy playing music on an entirely different level. Nowadays, I mostly stick to piano or guitar, purely for the sake of convenience. I have no real formal training in these (unless you count the brief lessons from when I was a tot), so I spend most of my time engrossed in improvisation (albeit amateurish). There is nothing like it– the feeling that I get, the state of mind that I can enter by letting my fingers run loose on the keys or the frets. I experience an indescribably pleasant synchronization of the tactile, kinesthetic, and auditory senses. It has become my loveliest and most dependable solace. I often find myself in the music hall at Duke at the strangest hours. Or, affected by some turn of events or inspired by some train of thought, I feel the need to unzip my guitar case in the middle of the night.

Music is the purest form of expression. With it, I can communicate uninhibited by the clumsiness and imprecision of speech. I can string together eloquent tales of joy, sorrow, or whatever else I feel or have ever felt before. I don’t believe that you can understand who I am without first hearing me play.
